1
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:33,975
 Anything that is harmful to you or to society, anything that is dangerous to you or to civil order, Allah has made it haram.

2
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:40,456
 Therefore, I'm telling you from now, you're not gonna understand every single ruling of Islam.

3
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:46,136
 You're not. Because that's not the purpose. There will be rulings you might be confused by.

4
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:48,695
 What is the wisdom? So find out, is it an act of...

5
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:59,112
 So never, ever give up hope in a lie.

6
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:02,632
 If you fell down, you have to stand up and continue walking.

7
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:08,132
 If you got yourself dirty, take a shower, change your clothes, and I mean physically and spiritually.

8
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
 Because we don't want to see you happy.

9
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
 No, we are strict because we want to see you happy.

10
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,480
 We are strict because we want to see you succeed.

11
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,920
 Dear youngsters, a day will come when you are parents

12
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,000
 that you will realize how much we love you.

13
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,639
 At this stage, it's too much for you to understand.

14
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
 But all that we do is out of love, out of concern, out of care.

15
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
 Every parent knows to see you succeed is our success.

16
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,720
 We will gladly give up our happiness for your happiness.

17
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,320
 and in that trying will be your success and our success as well. May Allah SWT bless me and you

18
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,720
 withran through the Qur'an and may He make us of those who its verses they understand and

19
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,840
 apply its halal and haram throughout our lifespan. I ask Allah's forgiveness, you as well ask Him

20
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
 For He is the wafoor and the rahmah.

21
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 Al-Habdullillah, all praise is due to Allah, the One and the Unique.

22
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 He is who we worship, and it is His aid that we seek.

23
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,559
 he is the lord of the oppressed and he hears the prayer of the weak. As to what follows,

24
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:58,015
 How cruel the world can be and maybe I'm not qualified to try to explain
